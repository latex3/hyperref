\section{Preface---February 2022}
As can be already seen in the following introduction, \xpackage{hyperref}
has a long history and has seen many changes over time. The introduction
mentions workflows, drivers and problems which are no longer relevant,
or only in edge cases. The documentation reflect this varied history: changes
and extensions and explanations were and are spread over various papers and sources and
only incorporated later and so are not always in a coherent order and in sync which each other.


This history is continuing: If you are using the new \hologo{LaTeX} PDF management
which is currently distributed as testphase package \xpackage{pdfmanagement-testphase}
then \xpackage{hyperref} will for the PDF output use a new generic driver which
contains a number of changes and new features. The documentation of this driver
\texttt{hyperref-generic.pdf}
is currently a part of the \xpackage{pdfmanagement-testphase} documentation.
One important change of the new driver is
that it removed the old \xpackage{hyperref} code for book marks and uses
the \xpackage{bookmark} package instead. So to learn
about options to extend the bookmarks you should consult the \xpackage{bookmark} documentation
too.

\subsection{Restoring removed patches}

\xpackage{hyperref} has over time patched quite a number of packages to resolve clashes and incompabilities.
Quite a number are either no longer needed or should be done by by the original packages. 
These patches are now slowly removed from \xpackage{hyperref}.  It should normally not lead to problems, but
in case that the patches should be restored they can be loaded through the package \xpackage{hyperref-patches} which
is a part of this bundle.



\section{Introduction}

The package derives from, and builds on, the work of the Hyper\hologo{TeX}
project, described at \nolinkurl{http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/}\footnote{Now: \url{https://ctan.org/tex-archive/support/hypertex/hypertex}}. It extends
the functionality of all the \hologo{LaTeX} cross-referencing commands
(including the table of contents, bibliographies etc) to produce
\cs{special} commands which a driver can turn into hypertext links;
it also provides new commands to allow the user to write \emph{ad hoc}
hypertext links, including those to external documents and URLs.

The package is currently maintained at \url{https://github.com/latex3/hyperref/} and issues should
be reported there.

This manual provides a brief overview of the \xpackage{hyperref}
package. For more details, you should read the additional documentation
distributed with the package, as well as the complete documentation by
processing \texttt{hyperref.dtx}. You should also read the chapter on
\xpackage{hyperref} in \textit{The \hologo{LaTeX} Web Companion}, where you will
find additional examples.

The Hyper\hologo{TeX} specification\footnote{This is borrowed from an article
by Arthur Smith.} says that conformant viewers/translators must
recognize the following set of \cs{special} constructs:

\begin{description}
\item[href:] \verb|html:<a href = "href_string">|
\item[name:] \verb|html:<a name = "name_string">|
\item[end:] \verb|html:</a>|
\item[image:] \verb|html:<img src = "href_string">|
\item[base\_name:] \verb|html:<base href = "href_string">|
\end{description}

The \emph{href}, \emph{name} and \emph{end} commands are used to do the
basic hypertext operations of establishing links between sections of
documents. The \emph{image} command is intended (as with current HTML
viewers) to place an image of arbitrary graphical format on the page in
the current location. The \emph{base\_name} command is be used to
communicate to the DVI viewer the full (URL) location of the current
document so that files specified by relative URLs may be retrieved
correctly.

The \emph{href} and \emph{name} commands must be paired with an
\emph{end} command later in the \TeX\ file---the \TeX\ commands between
the two ends of a pair form an \emph{anchor} in the document. In the
case of an \emph{href} command, the \emph{anchor} is to be highlighted
in the \emph{DVI viewer}, and when clicked on will cause the scene to
shift to the destination specified by \emph{href\_string}. The
\emph{anchor} associated with a name command represents a possible
location to which other hypertext links may refer, either as local
references (of the form \verb|href="#name_string"| with the
\emph{name\_string} identical to the one in the name command) or as part
of a URL (of the form \emph{URL\#name\_string}). Here
\emph{href\_string} is a valid URL or local identifier, while
\emph{name\_string} could be any string at all: the only caveat is that
`$\verb|"|$' characters should be escaped with a backslash
($\backslash$), and if it looks like a URL name it may cause problems.

However, the drivers intended to produce \emph{only} PDF use literal
PostScript or PDF \verb|\special| commands. The commands are defined in
configuration files for different drivers, selected by package options;
at present, the following drivers are supported:

\begin{description}
\item[hypertex] DVI processors conforming to the Hyper\TeX\ guidelines (i.e.\ \textsf{xdvi}, \textsf{dvips} (with
the \textsf{-z} option), \textsf{\hologo{OzTeX}}, and \textsf{Textures})
\item[dvips] produces \verb|\special| commands tailored for \textsf{dvips}
\item[dvipsone] produces \verb|\special| commands tailored for \textsf{dvipsone}
\item[ps2pdf] a special case of output suitable for processing by earlier versions of Ghost\-script's
PDF writer; this is basically the same as that for \textsf{dvips}, but a few variations remained before version 5.21
\item[tex4ht] produces \verb|\special| commands for use with \textsf{\TeX4ht}
\item[pdftex] pdf\TeX, \hologo{HanTheThanh}'s \TeX{} variant that writes PDF directly
\item[luatex] lua\TeX, Unicode \TeX{} variant that writes PDF directly
\item[dvipdfm] produces \verb|\special| commands for Mark Wicks' DVI to PDF driver \textsf{dvipdfm}
\item[dvipdfmx] produces \verb|\special| commands for driver
     \textsf{dvipdfmx}, a successor of \textsf{dvipdfm}
\item[dviwindo] produces \verb|\special| commands that Y\&Y's Windows previewer interprets as hypertext jumps within the previewer
\item[vtex] produces \verb|\special| commands that MicroPress' HTML and
     PDF-producing \TeX\ variants interpret as hypertext jumps within the
     previewer
\item[textures] produces \verb|\special| commands that \textsf{Textures} interprets as hypertext jumps within the previewer
\item[xetex] produces \verb|\special| commands for Xe\TeX{}
\end{description}

Output from \textsf{dvips} or \textsf{dvipsone} must be processed using
Acrobat Distiller to obtain a PDF file.\footnote{Make sure you turn off
the partial font downloading supported by \textsf{dvips} and
\textsf{dvipsone} in favor of Distiller's own system.} The result is
generally preferable to that produced by using the \textsf{hypertex}
driver, and then processing with \textsf{dvips -z}, but the DVI file is
not portable. The main advantage of using the Hyper\TeX\ \ci{special}
commands is that you can also use the document in hypertext DVI viewers,
such as \textsf{xdvi}.

\begin{description}
\item[driverfallback]
  If a driver is not given and cannot be autodetected, then use
  the driver option, given as value to this option \textsf{driverfallback}.
  Example:
  \begin{quote}
    \texttt{driverfallback=dvipdfm}
  \end{quote}
  Autodetected drivers (\textsf{pdftex}, \textsf{xetex}, \textsf{vtex},
  \textsf{vtexpdfmark}) are recognized from within \TeX\ and
  therefore cannot be given as value to option \textsf{driverfallback}.
  However a DVI driver program is run after the \TeX\ run is finished.
  Thus it cannot be detected at \TeX\ macro level. Then package
  \xpackage{hyperref}
  uses the driver, given by \textsf{driverfallback}. If the driver
  is already specified or can be autodetected, then option
  \textsf{driverfallback} is ignored.
\end{description}

\section{Implicit behavior}

This package can be used with more or less any normal \LaTeX\ document
by specifying in the document preamble

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

Make sure it comes \emph{last} of your loaded packages, to give it a
fighting chance of not being over-written, since its job is to redefine
many \LaTeX\ commands.\footnote{But work has started to reduce the
number of redefinition and so the dependencies on the loading order.}
Hopefully you will find that all cross-references
work correctly as hypertext. For example, \ci{section} commands will
produce a bookmark and a link, whereas \ci{section*} commands will only
show links when paired with a corresponding \ci{addcontentsline}
command.

In addition, the \texttt{hyperindex} option (see below) attempts to make
items in the index by hyperlinked back to the text, and the option
\texttt{backref} inserts extra `back' links into the bibliography for
each entry. Other options control the appearance of links, and give
extra control over PDF output. For example, \texttt{colorlinks}, as its
name well implies, colors the links instead of using boxes; this is the
option used in this document.

\section{Interfaces for class and package authors}

hyperlink features are nowadays a common requirement. \xpackage{hyperref}
patches quite a number of commands from the  \LaTeX{} core and from packages
to add such features. But this is rather fragile and it add dependencies
on the loading order and can break if the external packages break.
It is therefore much better if packages add suitable support to their commands directly.
Quite a lot packages actually did this, but due to missing documentation of the interface
they often looked into the code and then used internal commands not meant as public command.

The following tries to describe the existing variables and commands that
can be viewed as public interfaces or which should or can be set by packages
to stay compatible with the \xpackage{hyperref} command. Documented user commands
are naturally interfaces too, they are not explicitly mentioned here again.

This section is work in progress. Suggestions or comments are welcome.

\subsection{Counters}
Counters play an important part in the code. They are used to create destination names and
to define hierarchies like the bookmarks. To work correctly often they require some additional
setups.

\begin{description}

\item[\cs{theH<counter>}]  \xpackage{hyperref} creates destination names for
link anchor typically out of the name of the counter and the \cs{the<counter>} value.
This can fail, e.g. if \cs{the<counter>} is not unique through the document,
or if it is not expandable. In such cases \cs{theH<counter>} should be defined so that
it gives a unique, expandable value. It doesn't harm to define it even if
\xpackage{hyperref} is not loaded.

\item[\cs{toclevel@<counter>}] This is a variable which should contain a number.
It is used for the level in the bookmarks. It should be defined for all counters
which are used in toc like lists and \cs{addcontentsline}. Typical values are

\begin{verbatim}
\def\toclevel@part{-1}
\def\toclevel@chapter{0}
\def\toclevel@section{1}
\def\toclevel@subsection{2}
\def\toclevel@subsubsection{3}
\def\toclevel@paragraph{4}
\def\toclevel@subparagraph{5}
\def\toclevel@figure{0}
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}

\subsection{Links commands}
The following commands are provided by all drivers to create links.
They can be used by packages if the user commands are not sufficient.
New drivers must provide this commands with similar arguments.

\begin{verbatim}
 \hyper@anchor {destination name}
 \hyper@anchorstart {destination name}
 \hyper@anchorend
 \hyper@link   {context}{destination name}{link text}  %GoTo
 \hyper@linkstart {context} {destination name}         %GoTo
 \hyper@linkend                                        %GoTo
 \hyper@linkfile  {link text} {filename} {destname}    %GoToR
 \hyper@linkurl   {link text}{url}                     %URI
 \hyper@linklaunch{filename} {link text} {Parameters}  %Launch, only with new generic driver
 \hyper@linknamed {action}{link text}                  %Named, only with new generic driver
\end{verbatim}


\section{Package options}

All user-configurable aspects of \xpackage{hyperref} are set using a
single `key=value' scheme (using the \xpackage{keyval} package) with the
key \texttt{Hyp}. The options can be set either in the optional argument
to the \cs{usepackage} command, or using the \cs{hypersetup}
macro. When the package is loaded, a file \texttt{hyperref.cfg} is read
if it can be found, and this is a convenient place to set options on a
site-wide basis.

Note however that some options (for example \texttt{unicode}) can only be used as
package options, and not in \verb|\hypersetup| as the option settings are processed
as the package is read. The following tabular lists (hopefully all) these options.
Be aware that some of the option do nothing or have
changed behaviour if the new pdfmanagement and so the new generic hyperref driver is used.

\begin{tabular}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{5cm}}
option     & remark \\\hline
all driver options, e.g. \texttt{pdftex} & often not needed, as detected automatically\\
implicit   \\
pdfa       & no-op with new pdfmanagement, set the standard in \cs{DeclareDocumentMetadata}.\\
unicode    & is the default now anyway\\
pdfversion & no-op with new pdfmanagement, set the version in \cs{DeclareDocumentMetadata}.\\
bookmarks  & this will probably change at some time. \\
backref &\\
pagebackref & \\
destlabel  &\\
pdfusetitle &\\
pdfpagelabels &\\
hyperfootnotes &\\
hyperfigures&\\
hyperindex &\\
encap &\\
typexml & \\
CJKbookmarks & only with the new pdfmanagement, in other cases it can be used in \cs{hypersetup}\\
psdextra     & only with the new pdfmanagement, in other cases it can be used in \cs{hypersetup}\\
nesting      & only with the new pdfmanagement, in other cases it can be used in \cs{hypersetup} (but
               is quite unclear if it has any use)\\

\end{tabular}

As an example, the behavior of a particular file could be controlled by:
\begin{itemize}

\item	a site-wide \texttt{hyperref.cfg} setting up the look of links,
adding backreferencing, and setting a PDF display default:

\begin{verbatim}
\hypersetup{backref,
pdfpagemode=FullScreen,
colorlinks=true}
\end{verbatim}

\item	A global option in the file, which is passed down to
\textsf{hyperref}:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[dvips]{article}
\end{verbatim}

\item	File-specific options in the \cs{usepackage} commands, which
override the ones set in \texttt{hyperref.cfg}:

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[colorlinks=false]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{pdftitle={A Perfect Day}}
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

As seen in the previous example, information entries
(pdftitle, pdfauthor, \dots) should be set after the package is loaded.
Otherwise \LaTeX\ expands the values of these options prematurely.
Also \LaTeX\ strips spaces in options. Especially option `pdfborder'
requires some care. Curly braces protect the value, if given
as package option. They are not necessary in \verb|\hypersetup|.

\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[pdfborder={0 0 0}]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{pdfborder=0 0 0}
\end{verbatim}

Some options can be given at any time, but many are restricted: before
\verb|\begin{document}|, only in \verb|\usepackage[...]{hyperref}|,
before first use, etc.

In the key descriptions that follow, many options do not need a value,
as they default to the value true if used. These are the ones classed as
`boolean'. The values true and false can always be specified, however.

\subsection{General options}

Firstly, the options to specify general behavior and page size.

\medskip
\begin{longtable}{>{\ttfamily}ll>{\itshape}ll}
draft          & boolean & false & all hypertext options are turned off \\
final          & boolean & true  & all hypertext options are turned on \\
debug          & boolean & false & extra diagnostic messages are printed in \\
               &         &       & the log file \\
verbose        & boolean & false & same as debug \\
implicit       & boolean & true  & redefines \LaTeX\ internals \\
setpagesize    & boolean & true  & sets page size by special driver commands
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Options for destination names}

Destinations names (also anchor, target or link names) are internal
names that identify a position on a page in the document. They
are used in link targets for inner document links or the bookmarks,
for example.

Usually anchor are set, if \cs{refstepcounter} is called.
Thus there is a counter name and value. Both are used to
construct the destination name. By default the counter value
follows the counter name separated by a dot. Example for
the fourth chapter:
\begin{quote}
  \verb|chapter.4|
\end{quote}
This scheme is used by:
\begin{description}
\item[\cs{autoref}] displays the description label for the
  reference depending on the counter name.
\item[\cs{hyperpage}] is used by the index to get
page links. Page anchor setting (\verb|pageanchor|) must not
be turned off.
\end{description}

It is very important that the destination names are unique,
because two destinations must not share the same name.
The counter value \cs{the<counter>} is not always unique
for the counter. For example, table and figures can be numbered
inside the chapter without having the chapter number in their
number. Therefore \xpackage{hyperref} has introduced \cs{theH<counter>}
that allows a unique counter value without messing up with
the appearance of the counter number. For example, the number
of the second table in the third chapter might be printed
as \texttt{2}, the result of \cs{thetable}. But the
destination name \texttt{table.2.4} is unique because it
has used \cs{theHtable} that gives \verb|2.4| in this case.

Often the user do not need to set \cs{theH<counter>}. Defaults
for standard cases (chapter, \dots) are provided. And after \xpackage{hyperref}
is loaded, new counters with parent counters also define
\cs{theH<counter>} automatically, if \cs{newcounter}, \cs{@addtoreset}
or \cs{numberwithin} of package \xpackage{amsmath} are used.

Usually problems with duplicate destination names can be solved
by an appropriate definition of \cs{theH<counter>}. If option
\texttt{hypertexnames} is disabled, then a unique artificial
number is used instead of the counter value. In case of page
anchors the absolute page anchor is used. With option \texttt{plainpages}
the page anchors use the arabic form. In both latter cases \cs{hyperpage}
for index links is affected and might not work properly.

If an unnumbered entity gets an anchor (starred forms of
chapters, sections, \dots) or \cs{phantomsection} is used,
then the dummy counter name \texttt{section*} and an artificial
unique number is used.

If the final PDF file is going to be merged with another file, than
the destination names might clash, because both documents might
contain \texttt{chapter.1} or \texttt{page.1}. Also \xpackage{hyperref}
sets anchor with name \texttt{Doc-Start} at the begin of the document.
This can be resolved by redefining \cs{HyperDestNameFilter}.
Package \xpackage{hyperref} calls this macro each time, it uses a
destination name.
The macro must be expandable and expects the destination name
as only argument. As example, the macro is redefined to add
a prefix to all destination names:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand*{\HyperDestNameFilter}[1]{\jobname-#1}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
In document \texttt{docA} the destination name \texttt{chapter.2}
becomes \texttt{docA-chapter.2}.

Destination names can also be used from the outside in URIs(, if the
driver has not removed or changed them), for example:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
http://somewhere/path/file.pdf#nameddest=chapter.4
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
However using a number seems unhappy. If another chapter is added
before, the number changes. But it is very difficult to pass
a new name for the destination to the anchor setting process that
is usually deep hidden in the internals. The first name of
\cs{label} after the anchor setting seems a good approximation:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
  \section{Introduction}
  \label{intro}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Option \texttt{destlabel} checks for each \cs{label}, if there is
a new destination name active and replaces the destination
name by the label name. Because the destination name is already in use
because of the anchor setting, the new name is recorded in the \texttt{.aux}
file and used in the subsequent \hologo{LaTeX} run. The renaming is done by
a redefinition of \cs{HyperDestNameFilter}. That leaves the old
destination names intact (e.g., they are needed for \cs{autoref}).
This redefinition is also available as \cs{HyperDestLabelReplace},
thus that an own redefinition can use it.
The following example also adds a prefix for \emph{all} destination names:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand*{\HyperDestNameFilter}[1]{%
  \jobname-\HyperDestLabelReplace{#1}%
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The other case that only files prefixed that do not have a corresponding
\cs{label} is more complicate, because \cs{HyperDestLabelReplace} needs
the unmodified destination name as argument. This is solved by an
expandable string test (\cs{pdfstrcmp} of \hologo{pdfTeX}
or \cs{strcmp} of \hologo{XeTeX}, package \xpackage{pdftexcmds} also supports
\hologo{LuaTeX}):
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{pdftexcmds}
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\HyperDestNameFilter}[1]{%
  \ifcase\pdf@strcmp{#1}{\HyperDestLabelReplace{#1}} %
    \jobname-#1%
  \else
    \HyperDestLabelReplace{#1}%
  \fi
}
\makeatother
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

With option \texttt{destlabel} destinations can also named manually,
if the destination is not yet renamed:
\begin{quote}
\verb|\HyperDestRename{|\meta{destination}\verb|}{|\meta{newname}\verb|}|
\end{quote}

Hint: Anchors can also be named and set by \cs{hypertarget}.

\medskip
\begin{longtable}{>{\ttfamily}ll>{\itshape}ll}

\subsection{Configuration options}

\begin{longtable}{>{\ttfamily}ll>{\itshape}lp{9cm}}
raiselinks & boolean & true  & In the hypertex driver, the height of links is normally calculated by the driver as
                               simply the base line of contained text; this options forces \verb|\special| commands to
                               reflect the real height of the link (which could contain a graphic) \\
breaklinks & boolean & both & This option is in hyperref only used in the dviwindo driver, in all other cases it doesn't do anything sensible---it neither allows nor prevents links to be broken. The ocgx2 package
checks the state of the boolean.\\
pageanchor & boolean & true  & Determines whether every page is given an implicit anchor at the top left corner. If this
                               is turned off, \verb|\printindex| will not contain
                               valid hyperlinks. \\
nesting    & boolean & false & Allows links to be nested; no drivers currently support this.
\end{longtable}

Note for option \verb|breaklinks|:
The correct value is automatically set according to the driver features.
It can be overwritten for drivers that do not support broken links.
However, at any case, the link area will be wrong and displaced.

\subsection{Backend drivers}

If no driver is specified, the package tries to find a driver in
the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Autodetection, some \TeX\ processors can be detected at \TeX\ macro
  level (pdf\TeX, Xe\TeX, V\TeX).
\item Option \textsf{driverfallback}. If this option is set, its value
  is taken as driver option.
\item Macro \cs{Hy@defaultdriver}. The macro takes a driver file
  name (without file extension).
\item Package default is \textsf{hypertex}.
\end{enumerate}
Many distributions are using a driver file \texttt{hypertex.cfg} that
define \cs{Hy@defaultdriver} with \texttt{hdvips}. This is recommended
because driver \textsf{dvips} provides much more features than
\textsf{hypertex} for PDF generation.

\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}lp{.8\hsize}@{}}
driverfallback & Its value is used as driver option\\
            & if the driver is not given or autodetected.\\

xetex       & For use with Xe\TeX\ (using backend for dvipdfm).
\end{longtable}
\smallskip

If you use \textsf{dviwindo}, you may need to redefine the macro
\ci{wwwbrowser} (the default is \verb|C:\netscape\netscape|) to tell
\textsf{dviwindo} what program to launch. Thus, users of Internet
Explorer might add something like this to hyperref.cfg:

\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand{\wwwbrowser}{C:\string\Program\space
  Files\string\Plus!\string\Microsoft\space
  Internet\string\iexplore.exe}

\subsection{PDF-specific display options}
\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}ll>{\itshape}lp{7.6cm}@{}}
bookmarks          & boolean   & true   & A set of Acrobat bookmarks are written, in a manner similar to the
                                           table of contents, requiring two passes of \LaTeX. Some postprocessing
                                           of the bookmark file (file extension \texttt{.out}) may be needed to
                                           translate \LaTeX\ codes, since bookmarks must be written in  PDFEncoding.
                                           To aid this  process, the \texttt{.out} file is not rewritten by \LaTeX\
                                           if it is edited to contain a line \verb|\let\WriteBookmarks\relax| \\
bookmarksopen      & boolean   & false   & If Acrobat bookmarks are requested, show them with all the subtrees
                                           expanded. \\

    This option should be used to produce CJK bookmarks.
    Package \verb|hyperref|
    supports both normal and preprocessed mode of the \xpackage{CJK} package;
    during the creation of bookmarks, it simply replaces CJK's macros
    with special versions which expand to the corresponding character
    codes.  Note that without the `unicode' option of hyperref you get
    PDF files which actually violate the PDF specification because
    non-Unicode character codes are used -- some PDF readers localized
    for CJK languages (most notably Acroread itself) support this.
    Also note that option `CJKbookmarks' cannot be used together
    with option `unicode'.

    No mechanism is provided to translate non-Unicode bookmarks to
    Unicode; for portable PDF documents only Unicode encoding should
    be used.\\

                                           but the colorlinks option resets it to produce no border.
\end{longtable}

The color of link borders used to be specified \emph{only} as 3
numbers in the range 0..1, giving an RGB color. Since version 6.76a, the usual
color specifications of package \xpackage{(x)color} can be used if \xpackage{xcolor}
has been loaded.
For further information see description of package \xpackage{hycolor}.

The bookmark commands are stored in a file called
\textit{jobname}\texttt{.out}. The files is not processed by \LaTeX\ so
any markup is passed through. You can postprocess this file as needed;
as an aid for this, the \texttt{.out} file is not overwritten on the
next \TeX\ run if it is edited to contain the line
\begin{verbatim}
\let\WriteBookmarks\relax

Each link in Acrobat carries its own magnification level, which is set
using PDF coordinate space, which is not the same as \TeX's. The unit
is bp and the origin is in the lower left corner. See also
\verb|\hypercalcbp| that is explained on page \pageref{hypercalcbp}.
pdf\TeX\
works by supplying default values for \texttt{XYZ} (horizontal $\times$
vertical $\times$ zoom) and \texttt{FitBH}. However, drivers using
\texttt{pdfmark} do not supply defaults, so \textsf{hyperref} passes in
a value of -32768, which causes Acrobat to set (usually) sensible
defaults. The following are possible values for the \texttt{pdfview},
\texttt{pdfstartview} and \texttt{pdfremotestartview} parameters.

\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}lp{7cm}@{}}

FitBH & top                   & Fits the width of the page bounding box to the window. \\
FitBV & left                  & Fits the height of the page bounding box to the window. \\
\end{longtable}

The \texttt{pdfpagelayout} can be one of the following values.

\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}lp{10cm}@{}}
SinglePage     & Displays a single page; advancing flips the page \\
OneColumn      & Displays the document in one column; continuous scrolling. \\
TwoColumnLeft  & Displays the document in two columns, odd-numbered pages to the left. \\
TwoColumnRight & Displays the document in two columns, odd-numbered pages to the right.\\
TwoPageLeft    & Displays two pages, odd-numbered pages to the left (since PDF 1.5).\\
TwoPageRight   & Displays two pages, odd-numbered pages to the right (since PDF 1.5).
\end{longtable}

Finally, the \texttt{pdfpagetransition} can be one of the following
values, where \textit{/Di} stands for direction of motion in degrees,
generally in 90$^{\circ}$\ steps, \textit{/Dm} is a horizontal
(\texttt{/H}) or vertical (\texttt{/V}) dimension (e.g.\ \texttt{Blinds
/Dm /V}), and \textit{/M} is for motion, either in (\texttt{/I}) or out
(\texttt{/O}).

\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}llp{8.5cm}@{}}
Blinds   & /Dm    & Multiple lines distributed evenly across the screen sweep in the same direction to reveal the new
                    page. \\
Box      & /M     & A box sweeps in or out. \\
Dissolve &        & The page image dissolves in a piecemeal fashion to reveal the new page. \\
Glitter  & /Di    & Similar to Dissolve, except the effect sweeps across the screen. \\
Split    & /Dm /M & Two lines sweep across the screen to reveal the new page. \\
Wipe     & /Di    & A single line sweeps across the screen to reveal the new page. \\
R        &        & Simply replaces the old page with the new one. \\
Fly      & /Di /M & Changes are flown out or in (as specified by /M), in the direction
                    specified by /Di, to or from a location that is
                    offscreen except when /Di is None. \\
Push     & /Di    & The old page slides off the screen while the new page slides in,
                    pushing the old page out in the direction
                    specified by /Di. \\
Cover    & /Di    & The new page slides on to the screen in the direction specified
                    by /Di, covering the old page. \\
Uncover  & /Di    & The old page slides off the screen in the direction specified by
                    /Di, uncovering the new page in the direction
                    specified by /Di. \\
Fade     &        & The new page gradually becomes visible through the old one.

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Option \texttt{pdfinfo}}

The information entries can be set using \texttt{pdftitle},
\texttt{pdfsubject}, \dots. Option \texttt{pdfinfo} provides an alternative
interface. It takes a key value list. The key names are the names that
appear in the PDF information dictionary directly. Known keys such as
\texttt{Title}, \texttt{Subject}, \texttt{Trapped} and other are mapped to
options \texttt{pdftitle}, \texttt{subject}, \texttt{trapped}, \dots
Unknown keys are added to the information dictionary. Their values are text
strings (see PDF specification).
Example:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\hypersetup{
  pdfinfo={
    Title={My Title},
    Subject={My Subject},
    NewKey={Foobar},
    % ...
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\section{Additional user macros}

If you need to make references to URLs, or write explicit links, the
following low-level user macros are provided:

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{href}\verb|[|\emph{options}\verb|]|\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent The \emph{text} is made a hyperlink to the \emph{URL}; this
must be a full URL (relative to the base URL, if that is defined). The
special characters \# and \~{} do \emph{not} need to be escaped in any
way (unless the command is used in the argument of another command).

The optional argument \emph{options} recognizes the hyperref options
\texttt{pdfremotestartview}, \texttt{pdfnewwindow} and the following
key value options:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{page}:] Specifies the start page number of remote
PDF documents. First page is \verb|1|.
\item[\texttt{ismap}:] Boolean key, if set to \verb|true|, the
URL should appended by the coordinates as query parameters by
the PDF viewer.
\item[\texttt{nextactionraw}:] The value of key \verb|/Next| of
action dictionaries, see PDF specification.
\end{description}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{url}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent Similar to
\ci{href}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}{|\ci{nolinkurl}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}}|.
Depending on the driver \verb|\href| also tries to detect the link type.
Thus the result can be a url link, file link, \dots

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{nolinkurl}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent Write \emph{URL} in the same way as \verb|\url|,
  without creating a hyperlink.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperbaseurl}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent A base \emph{URL} is established, which is prepended to other
specified URLs, to make it easier to write portable documents.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperimage}\verb|{|\emph{imageURL}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent The link to the image referenced by the URL is inserted, using
\emph{text} as the anchor.

  For drivers that produce HTML, the image itself is inserted by the
browser, with the \emph{text} being ignored completely.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperdef}\verb|{|\emph{category}\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent A target area of the document (the \emph{text}) is marked, and
given the name \emph{category.name}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperref}\verb|{|\emph{URL}\verb|}{|\emph{category}\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent \emph{text} is made into a link to \emph{URL\#category.name}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperref}\verb|[|\emph{label}\verb|]{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent
\emph{text} is made into a link to the same place as
\verb|\ref{|\emph{label}\verb|}| would be linked.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperlink}\verb|{|\emph{name}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hypertarget}\verb|{|\emph{name}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent A simple internal link is created with \verb|\hypertarget|,
with two parameters of an anchor \emph{name}, and anchor
\emph{text}. \verb|\hyperlink| has two arguments, the name of a
hypertext object defined somewhere by \verb|\hypertarget|, and the
\emph{text} which be used as the link on the page.

Note that in HTML parlance, the \verb|\hyperlink| command inserts a
notional \# in front of each link, making it relative to the current
testdocument; \verb|\href| expects a full URL.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{phantomsection}
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent
This sets an anchor at this location. It works similar to
\verb|\hypertarget{}{}| with an automatically chosen anchor name.
Often it is used in conjunction
with \verb|\addcontentsline| for sectionlike things (index, bibliography,
preface). \verb|\addcontentsline| refers to the latest previous location
where an anchor is set. Example:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\indexname}
\printindex
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Now the entry in the table of contents (and bookmarks) for the
index points to the start of the index page, not to a location
before this page.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperget}\verb|{|\emph{anchor}\verb|}{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\ci{hyperget}\verb|{|\emph{pageanchor}\verb|}{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

This retrieves the anchor or the page anchor from a label in an expandable way.
It takes \verb|\HyperDestNameFilter| into account. It can e.g. be used with the
\verb|\bookmark| from the bookmark package to set a destination to a label:

\begin{verbatim}
\bookmark[dest=\hyperget{anchor}{sec}]{section}
\end{verbatim}

As \emph{pageanchor} retrieves the page number from the label it can't be use together with
the option \texttt{plainpages}.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hyperget}\verb|{|\emph{currentanchor}\verb|}{}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

This retrieves the last anchor that has been set. It too takes \verb|\HyperDestNameFilter| into account.



\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{autoref}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent
This is a replacement for the usual \verb|\ref| command that places a
contextual label in front of the reference. This gives your users a
bigger target to click for hyperlinks (e.g.\ `section 2' instead of
merely the number `2').

The label is worked out from the context of the original \verb|\label|
command by \textsf{hyperref} by using the macros listed below (shown
with their default values). The macros can be (re)defined in documents
using \verb|\(re)newcommand|; note that some of these macros are already
defined in the standard document classes. The mixture of lowercase and
uppercase initial letters is deliberate and corresponds to the author's
practice.

For each macro below, \textsf{hyperref} checks \ci{*autorefname} before
\ci{*name}.  For instance, it looks for \ci{figureautorefname} before
\ci{figurename}.

\begin{longtable}{@{}lp{10cm}@{}}
\textit{Macro}         & \textit{Default} \\
\ci{figurename}        & Figure \\
\ci{tablename}         & Table \\
\ci{partname}          & Part \\
\ci{appendixname}      & Appendix \\
\ci{equationname}      & Equation \\
\ci{Itemname}          & item \\
\ci{chaptername}       & chapter \\
\ci{sectionname}       & section \\
\ci{subsectionname}    & subsection \\
\ci{subsubsectionname} & subsubsection \\
\ci{paragraphname}     & paragraph \\
\ci{Hfootnotename}     & footnote \\
\ci{AMSname}           & Equation \\
\ci{theoremname}       & Theorem\\
\ci{page}              & page\\
\end{longtable}

Example for a redefinition if \textsf{babel} is used:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\addto\extrasngerman{%
  \def\subsectionautorefname{Unterkapitel}%
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Hint: \cs{autoref} works via the counter name that the reference
is based on. Sometimes \cs{autoref} chooses the wrong name, if
the counter is used for different things. For example, it happens
with \cs{newtheorem} if a lemma shares a counter with theorems.
Then package \xpackage{aliascnt} provides a method to generate a
simulated second counter that allows the differentiation between
theorems and lemmas:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{aliascnt}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\newaliascnt{lemma}{theorem}
\newtheorem{lemma}[lemma]{Lemma}
\aliascntresetthe{lemma}

\providecommand*{\lemmaautorefname}{Lemma}

\begin{document}

We will use \autoref{a} to prove \autoref{b}.

\begin{lemma}\label{a}
  Nobody knows.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}\label{b}
  Nobody is right.
\end{theorem}.

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{autopageref}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent
It replaces \verb|\pageref| and adds the name for page in front of
the page reference. First \ci{pageautorefname} is checked before
\ci{pagename}.

For instances where you want a reference to use the correct counter, but
not to create a link, there are starred forms (these starred forms exist even if
hyperref has been loaded with \verb|implicit=false|):

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{ref*}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{pageref*}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{autoref*}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{autopageref*}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

A typical use would be to write
\begin{verbatim}
\hyperref[other]{that nice section (\ref*{other}) we read before}
\end{verbatim}

We want \verb|\ref*{other}| to generate the correct number, but not to
form a link, since we do this ourselves with \ci{hyperref}.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{pdfstringdef}\verb|{|\emph{macroname}\verb|}{|\emph{\TeX string}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\ci{pdfstringdef} returns a macro containing the PDF string. (Currently
this is done globally, but do not rely on it.) All the following tasks,
definitions and redefinitions are made in a group to keep them local:

\begin{itemize}
\item Switching to PD1 or PU encoding
\item Defining the \Quote{octal sequence commands} (\verb|\345|): \verb|\edef\3{\string\3}|
\item Special glyphs of \TeX: \verb|\{|, \verb|\%|, \verb|\&|, \verb|\space|, \verb|\dots|, etc.
\item National glyphs (\textsf{german.sty}, \textsf{french.sty}, etc.)
\item Logos: \verb|\TeX|, \verb|\eTeX|, \verb|\MF|, etc.
\item Disabling commands that do not provide useful functionality in bookmarks:
\verb|\label|, \verb|\index|, \verb|\glossary|, \verb|\discretionary|, \verb|\def|, \verb|\let|, etc.
\item \LaTeX's font commands like \verb|\textbf|, etc.
\item Support for \verb|\xspace| provided by the \xpackage{xspace} package
\end{itemize}

In addition, parentheses are protected to avoid the danger of unsafe
unbalanced parentheses in the PDF string. For further details, see Heiko
Oberdiek's Euro\TeX\ paper distributed with \textsf{hyperref}.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{begin}\verb|{NoHyper}|\ldots\ci{end}\verb|{NoHyper}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
 Sometimes we just don't want the wretched package interfering
 with us. Define an environment we can put in manually, or include
 in a style file, which stops the hypertext functions doing anything.
 This is used, for instance, in the Elsevier classes, to stop
 \verb|hyperref| playing havoc in the front matter.

\subsection{Bookmark macros}

\subsubsection{Setting bookmarks}

Usually \textsf{hyperref} automatically adds bookmarks for
\verb|\section| and similar macros. But they can also set manually.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{pdfbookmark}\verb|[|\emph{level}\verb|]{|text\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
creates a bookmark with the specified text and at the given level (default is
0). As name for the internal anchor name is used (in conjunction with
level). Therefore the name must be unique (similar to \verb|\label|).

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{currentpdfbookmark}\verb|{|\emph{text}\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
creates a bookmark at the current level.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{subpdfbookmark}\verb|{|\emph{text}\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
creates a bookmark one step down in the bookmark hierarchy.
Internally the current level is increased by one.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{belowpdfbookmark}\verb|{|\emph{text}\verb|}{|\emph{name}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
creates a bookmark below the current bookmark level. However after the
command the current bookmark level has not changed.

\noindent \textbf{Hint:} Package \textsf{bookmark} replaces
\textsf{hyperref}'s bookmark organization by a new algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Usually only one \LaTeX\ run is needed.
\item More control over the bookmark appearance (color, font).
\item Different bookmark actions are supported (external file links,
  URLs, \dots).
\end{itemize}
Therefore I recommend using this package.

\subsubsection{Replacement macros}\label{sec:texorpdfstring}

\textsf{hyperref} takes the text for bookmarks from the arguments of
commands like \ci{section}, which can contain things like math, colors,
or font changes, none of which will display in bookmarks as is.

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{texorpdfstring}\verb|{|\emph{\TeX string}\verb|}{|\emph{PDFstring}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\section{Pythagoras:
  \texorpdfstring{$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $}{%
    a\texttwosuperior\ + b\texttwosuperior\ =
    c\texttwosuperior
  }%
}
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{red}}{}{Red} Mars}
\end{verbatim}

\ci{pdfstringdef} executes the hook \pdfstringdefPreHook before it
expands the string. Therefore, you can use this hook to perform
additional tasks or to disable additional commands.

\begin{verbatim}
\expandafter\def\expandafter\pdfstringdefPreHook
\expandafter{%
  \pdfstringdefPreHook
  \renewcommand{\mycommand}[1]{}%
}
\end{verbatim}

However, for disabling commands, an easier way is via
\ci{pdfstringdefDisableCommands}, which adds its argument to the
definition of \ci{pdfstringdefPreHook} (`@' can here be used as letter in
command names):

\begin{verbatim}
\pdfstringdefDisableCommands{%
  \let~\textasciitilde
  \def\url{\pdfstringdefWarn\url}%
  \let\textcolor\@gobble
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Pagelabels}
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{thispdfpagelabel}\verb|{|\emph{page number format}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

This allows to change format of the page number shown in the tool bar of
a PDF viewer for a specific page, for example

\verb+\thispdfpagelabel{Empty Page-\roman{page}}+

The command affects the page on which it is executed, so asynchronous page breaking
should be taken into account. It should be used in places where for example \verb+\thispagestyle+ can be use too.

\subsection{Utility macros}

\label{hypercalcbp}
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{hypercalcbp}\verb|{|\emph{dimen specification}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
\noindent
\verb|\hypercalcbp| takes a \TeX\ dimen specification and
converts it to bp and returns the number without the unit.
This is useful for options \verb|pdfview|, \verb|pdfstartview|
and \verb|pdfremotestartview|.
Example:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\hypersetup{
  pdfstartview={FitBH \hypercalcbp{\paperheight-\topmargin-1in
    -\headheight-\headsep}
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The origin of the PDF coordinate system is the lower left corner.

Note, for calculations you need either package \xpackage{calc} or
\hologo{eTeX}. Nowadays the latter should automatically be enabled
for \hologo{LaTeX} formats. Users without \hologo{eTeX}, please, look
in the source documentation \verb|hyperref.dtx| for further
limitations.

Also \cs{hypercalcbp} cannot be used in option specifications
of \cs{documentclass} and \cs{usepackage}, because
\hologo{LaTeX} expands the option lists of these commands. However
package \xpackage{hyperref} is not yet loaded and an undefined control
sequence error would arise.

\section[New Features]{New Features%
\footnote{This section moved from the README file, needs more integration into the manual}}


\subsection{Option `pdflinkmargin'}

 Option `pdflinkmargin' is an experimental option for specifying
  a link margin, if the driver supports this. Default is 1 pt for
  supporting drivers.


\begin{description}
\item[pdfTeX]
\begin{itemize}
 \item The link area also depends on the surrounding box.
 \item Settings have local effect.
 \item When a page is shipped out, pdfTeX uses the current setting
    of the link margin for all links on the page.
\end{itemize}

\item[pdfmark]
\begin{itemize}
 \item Settings have global effect.
\end{itemize}

\item[xetex]
\begin{itemize}
 \item Settings must be done in the preamble or the first page and then have global effect.
       The key inserts the new (x)dvipdfmx special \verb|\special{dvipdfmx:config g #1}| (with the unit removed).
\end{itemize}

\item[Other drivers]
 Unsupported.
\end{description}


\subsection{Field option `calculatesortkey'}

 Fields with calculated values are calculated in document order
  by default. If calculated field values depend on other calculated
  fields that appear later in the document, then the correct calculation
  order can be specified with option `calculatesortkey'. Its value is
  used as key to lexicographically sort the calculated fields.
  The sort key do not need to be unique. Fields that share the same
  key are sorted in document order.



 Currently the field option `calculatesortkey' is only supported by
  the driver for pdfTeX.

\subsection{Option `next-anchor'}
This option allows to overwrite the anchor name of the next anchor.
This makes it possible to give for example the heading of the table of contents
an anchor name which can be referenced with a bookmark command.

\begin{verbatim}
\hypersetup{next-anchor=toc}
\tableofcontents
\bookmark[dest=\HyperDestNameFilter{toc},level=section]{\contentsname}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Option `localanchorname'}

 When an anchor is set (e.g. via \verb|\refstepcounter|, then the
  anchor name is globally set to the current anchor name.


 For example:
\begin{verbatim}
    \section{Foobar}
    \begin{equation}\end{equation}
    \label{sec:foobar}
\end{verbatim}
  With the default global setting (localanchorname=false)
  a reference to `sec:foobar' jumps to the equation before.
  With option `localanchorname' the anchor of the equation
  is forgotten after the environment and the reference
  `sec:foobar' jumps to the section title.


 Option `localanchorname' is an experimental option, there
  might be situations, where the anchor name is not available
  as expected.


\subsection{Option `customdriver'}

 The value of option `customdriver' is the name of an external
  driver file without extension `.def'. The file must have
  \verb|\ProvidesFile| with a version date and number that match the
  date and number of `hyperref', otherwise a warning is given.

 Because the interface, what needs to be defined in the driver,
  is not well defined and quite messy, the option is mainly intended
  to ease developing, testing, debugging the driver part.


\subsection{Option `psdextra'}

 LaTeX's NFSS is used to assist the conversion of arbitrary
  TeX strings to PDF strings (bookmarks, PDF information entries).
  Many math command names (\verb|\geq|, \verb|\notin|, ...) are not in control
  of NFSS, therefore they are defined with prefix `text'
  (\verb|\textgeq|, \verb|\textnotin|, ...). They can be mapped to short names
  during the processing to PDF strings. The disadvantage is that
  they are many hundreds macros that need to be redefined for
  each PDF string conversion. Therefore this can be enabled or
  disabled as option `psdextra'. On default the option is turned
  off (set to `false'). Turning the option on means
  that the short names are available. Then \verb|\geq| can directly
  be used instead of \verb|\textgeq|.


\subsection{\textbackslash XeTeXLinkBox}

 When XeTeX generates a link annotation, it does not look
  at the boxes (as the other drivers), but only at the character
  glyphs. If there are no glyphs (images, rules, ...), then
  it does not generate a link annotation. Macro \verb|\XeTeXLinkBox|
  puts its argument in a box and adds spaces at the lower left
  and upper right corners. An additional margin can be specified
  by setting it to the dimen register \verb|\XeTeXLinkMargin|. The default
  is 2pt.

 Example:


\begin{verbatim}
    % xelatex
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \setlength{\XeTeXLinkMargin}{1pt}
    \begin{document}
    \section{Hello World}
    \newpage
    \label{sec:hello}
    \hyperref[sec:hello]{%
      \XeTeXLinkBox{\rule{10mm}{10mm}}%
    }
    \end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\textbackslash IfHyperBooleanExists and \textbackslash IfHyperBoolean}
\begin{verbatim}
 \IfHyperBooleanExists{OPTION}{YES}{NO}
\end{verbatim}
  If a hyperref OPTION is a boolean, that means it takes values
  `true' or `false', then \verb|\IfHyperBooleanExists| calls YES, otherwise NO.


\begin{verbatim}
 \IfHyperBoolean{OPTION}{YES}{NO}
\end{verbatim}
  Macro \verb|\IfHyperBoolean| calls YES, if OPTION exists as boolean and is
  enabled. Otherwise NO is executed.



 Both macros are expandable. Additionally option `stoppedearly' is
  available. It is enabled if \verb|\MaybeStopEarly| or \verb|\MaybeStopNow|
  end hyperref prematurely.


\subsection{\textbackslash unichar}

 If a Unicode character is not supported by puenc.def, it can
  be given by using \verb|\unichar|. Its name and syntax is inherited
  from package `ucs'. However it is defined independently for
  use in hyperref's \verb|\pdfstringdef| (that converts arbitrary
  TeX code to PDF strings or tries to do this).



 Macro \verb|\unichar| takes a TeX number as argument,
  examples for U+263A (WHITE SMILING FACE):
\begin{verbatim}
    \unichar{"263A}% hexadecimal notation
    \unichar{9786}% decimal notation
\end{verbatim}
  `"' must not be a babel shorthand character or otherwise
  active. Otherwise prefix it with \verb|\string|:
\begin{verbatim}
    \unichar{\string"263A}% converts `"' to `"' with catcode 12 (other)
\end{verbatim}
  Users of (n)german packages or babel options may use \verb|\dq| instead:
\begin{verbatim}
    \unichar{\dq 263A}% \dq is double quote with catcode 12 (other)
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{\textbackslash ifpdfstringunicode}

 Some features of the PDF specification needs PDF strings.
  Examples are bookmarks or the entries in the information dictionary.
  The PDF specification allows two encodings `PDFDocEncoding'
  (8-bit encoding) and `Unicode' (UTF-16). The user can help
  using \verb|\texorpdfstring| to replace complicate TeX constructs
  by a representation for the PDF string. However \verb|\texorpdfstring|
  does not distinguish the two encodings. This gap closes
  \verb|\ifpdfstringunicode|. It is only allowed in the second argument
  of \verb|\texorpdfstring| and takes two arguments, the first allows
  the full range of Unicode. The second is limited to the
  characters available in PDFDocEncoding.



 As example we take a macro definition for the Vietnamese
  name of \hologo{HanTheThanh}. Correctly written it needs some
  accented characters, one character even with a double accent.
  Class `tugboat.cls' defines a macro for the typesetted name:
\begin{verbatim}
    \def\Thanh{%
      H\`an~%
      Th\^e\llap{\raise 0.5ex\hbox{\'{}}}%
      ~Th\`anh%
    }
\end{verbatim}
  It's not entirely correct, the second accent over the `e' is not
  an acute, but a hook. However standard LaTeX does not provide
  such an accent.

    Now we can extend the definition to support hyperref.
  The first and the last word are already supported automatically.
  Characters with two or more accents are a difficult business in
  LaTeX, because the NFSS2 macros of the LaTeX kernel do not support
  more than one accent. Therefore also puenc.def misses support for
  them. But we can provide it using \verb|\unichar|. The character
  in question is:
\begin{verbatim}
    % U+1EC3 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND HOOK ABOVE
\end{verbatim}
  Thus we can put this together:
\begin{verbatim}
    \def\Thanh{%
      H\`an~%
      \texorpdfstring{Th\^e\llap{\raise 0.5ex\hbox{\'{}}}}%
      {\ifpdfstringunicode{Th\unichar{"1EC3}}{Th\^e}}%
      ~Th\`anh%
    }
\end{verbatim}
  For PDFDocEncoding (PD1) the variant above has dropped the
  second accent. Alternatively we could provide a representation
  without accents instead of wrong accents:
\begin{verbatim}
    \def\Thanh{%
      \texorpdfstring{%
        H\`an~%
        Th\^e\llap{\raise 0.5ex\hbox{\'{}}}}%
        ~Th\`anh%
      }{%
        \ifpdfstringunicode{%
          H\`an Th\unichar{"1EC3} Th\`anh%
        }{%
          Han The Thanh%
        }%
      }%
    }
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Customizing index style file with \textbackslash nohyperpage}

 Since version 2008/08/14~v6.78f.



 For hyperlink support in the index, hyperref inserts \verb|\hyperpage|
  into the index macros. After processing with Makeindex, \verb|\hyperpage|
  analyzes its argument to detect page ranges and page comma lists.
  However, only the standard settings are supported directly:
\begin{verbatim}
    delim_r "--"
    delim_n ", "
\end{verbatim}
  (See manual page/documentation of Makeindex that explains
  the keys that can be used in style files for Makeindex.)
  Customized versions of
    \verb|delim_r, delim_n, suffix_2p, suffix_3p, suffix_mp|
  needs markup that \verb|\hyperpage| can detect and knows that
  this stuff does not belong to a page number. Makro
  \verb|\nohyperpage| serves as this markup. Put the customized
  code for these keys inside \verb|\nohyperpage|, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
    suffix_2p "\\nohyperpage{f.}"
    suffix_3p "\\nohyperpage{ff.}"
\end{verbatim}
  (Depending on the typesetting tradition some space ``\verb|\\|,'' or ``\verb|~|''
  should be put before the first f inside \verb|\nohyperpage|.)


\subsection{Experimental option `ocgcolorlinks'}

 The idea are colored links, when viewed, but printed without colors.
  This new experimental option `ocgcolorlinks' uses Optional Content
  Groups, a feature introduced in PDF 1.5.

  A better implementation which hasn't the disadvantage to prevent line breaks is
  in the ocgx2 package. Check its documentation for details how to use it.
\begin{itemize}
 \item The option must be given for package loading:
      \verb|\usepackage[ocgcolorlinks]{hyperref}|
 \item Main disadvantage: Links cannot be broken across lines.
    PDF reference 1.7: 4.10.2 ``Making Graphical Content Optional'':
      Graphics state operations, such as setting the color, ...,
      are still applied.
    Therefore the link text is put in a box and set twice, with and
    without color.
 \item The feature can be switched of by \verb|\hypersetup{ocgcolorlinks=false}|
    inside the document.
 \item Supported drivers: pdftex, dvipdfm
 \item The PDF version should be at least 1.5. It is automatically
    set for pdfTeX, LuaTeX and dvipdfmx.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option `pdfa'}

 The new option `pdfa' tries to avoid violations of PDF/A in code
  generated by hyperref. However, the result is usually not in PDF/A,
  because many features aren't controlled by hyperref (XMP metadata,
  fonts, colors, driver dependend low level stuff, ...).



 Currently, option `pdfa' sets and disables the following items:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Enabled annotation flags: Print, NoZoom, NoRotate [PDF/A 6.5.3].
 \item Disabled annotation flags: Hidden, Invisible, NoView [PDF/A 6.5.3].
 \item Disabled: Launch action (\href{run:...} [PDF/A 6.6.1].
 \item Restricted: Named actions (\Acrobatmenu: NextPage, PrevPage,
    FirstPage, LastPage) [PDF/A 6.6.1].
 \item Many things are disabled in PDF formulars:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item JavaScript actions [PDF/A 6.6.1]
   \item Trigger events (additional actions) [PDF/A 6.6.2]
   \item Push button (because of JavaScript)
   \item Interactive Forms: Flag NeedAppearances is the default `false'
      (Because of this, hyperref's implementation of Forms looks ugly).
      [PDF/A 6.9]
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



 The default value of the new option `pdfa' is `false'. It influences
  the loading of the package and cannot be changed after hyperref is
  loaded (\verb|\usepackage{hyperref}|).



\subsection{Option `linktoc' added}

 The new option `linktoc' allows more control which part
  of an entry in the table of contents is made into a link:
\begin{itemize}
 \item `linktoc=none'    (no links)
 \item `linktoc=section' (default behaviour, same as `linktocpage=false')
 \item `linktoc=page'    (same as `linktocpage=true')
 \item `linktoc=all'     (both the section and page part are links)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option `pdfnewwindow' changed}

 Before 6.77b:
\begin{itemize}
 \item pdfnewwindow=true $\rightarrow$ /NewWindow true
 \item pdfnewwindow=false $\rightarrow$ (absent)
 \item unused pdfnewwindow $\rightarrow$ (absent)
\end{itemize}
  Since 6.77b:
\begin{itemize}
 \item pdfnewwindow=true $\rightarrow$ /NewWindow true
 \item pdfnewwindow=false $\rightarrow$ /NewWindow false
 \item pdfnewwindow={} $\rightarrow$ (absent)
 \item unused pdfnewwindow $\rightarrow$ (absent)
\end{itemize}



 Rationale: There is a difference between setting to `false'
  and an absent entry. In the former case the new document
  replaces the old one, in the latter case the PDF viewer
  application should respect the user preference.


\subsection{Flag options for PDF forms}

 PDF form field macros (\verb|\TextField|, \verb|\CheckBox|, ...) support
  boolean flag options. The option name is the lowercase
  version of the names in the PDF specification (1.7):

    \url{http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html}

    \url{http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference.pdf}

  Options (convert to lowercase) except flags in square brackets:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Table 8.16 Annotation flags (page 608):

{\obeylines
    1 Invisible
    2 Hidden (PDF 1.2)
    3 Print (PDF 1.2)
    4 NoZoom (PDF 1.3)
    5 NoRotate (PDF 1.3)
    6 NoView (PDF 1.3)
    [7 ReadOnly (PDF 1.3)] ignored for widget annotations, see table 8.70
    8 Locked (PDF 1.4)
    9 ToggleNoView (PDF 1.5)
    10 LockedContents (PDF 1.7)
}
 \item Table 8.70 Field flags common to all field types (page 676):

    25 Comb (PDF 1.5)
    26 RichText (PDF 1.5)
}
 \item Table 8.79 Field flags specific to choice fields (page 693):

{\obeylines

    19 Edit (only useful if Combo is set)
    20 (Sort) for authoring tools, not PDF viewers
    22 MultiSelect (PDF 1.4)
    23 DoNotSpellCheck (PDF 1.4) (only useful if Combo and Edit are set)
    27 CommitOnSelChange (PDF 1.5)
}
 \item Table 8.86 Flags for submit-form actions (page 704):

{\obeylines
    [1 Include/Exclude] unsupported, use `noexport' (table 8.70) instead
    2 IncludeNoValueFields

    4 GetMethod
    5 SubmitCoordinates
    [6 XFDF (PDF 1.4)] handled by option `export'
    7 IncludeAppendSaves (PDF 1.4)
    8 IncludeAnnotations (PDF 1.4)
    [9 SubmitPDF (PDF 1.4)] handled by option `export'
    10 CanonicalFormat (PDF 1.4)
    11 ExclNonUserAnnots (PDF 1.4)
    12 ExclFKey (PDF 1.4)
    14 EmbedForm (PDF 1.5)
}
\end{itemize}

 New option `export' sets the export format of a submit action.
  Valid values are (upper- or lowercase):
\begin{itemize}
 \item FDF
 \item HTML
 \item XFDF
 \item PDF (not supported by Acrobat Reader)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option `pdfversion'}

 This is an experimental option. It notifies `hyperref' about
  the intended PDF version. Currently this is used in code for
  PDF forms (implementation notes 116 and 122 of PDF spec 1.7).



 Values: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7. Values below 1.2 are not
  supported, because most drivers expect higher PDF versions.



 The option must be used early, not after \verb|\usepackage{hyperref}|.


 In theory this option should also set the PDF version,
  but this is not generally supported.
\begin{itemize}
 \item pdfTeX below 1.10a: unsupported.
    pdfTeX $\ge$ 1.10a and < 1.30: \verb|\pdfoptionpdfminorversion|
    pdfTeX $\ge$ 1.30: \verb|\pdfminorversion|
 \item dvipdfm: configuration file, example:
    TeX Live 2007, texmf/dvipdfm/config/config, entry `V 2'.
 \item dvipdfmx: configuration file, example:
    TeX Live 2007, texmf/dvipdfm/dvipdfmx.cfg, entry `V 4'.
 \item Ghostscript: option -dCompatibilityLevel (this is set in
    `ps2pdf12', `ps2pdf13', `ps2pdf14').
\end{itemize}


 The current PDF version is used as default if this version
  can be detected (only pdfTeX $\ge$ 1.10a). Otherwise the lowest
  version 1.2 is assumed. Thus `hyperref' tries to avoid PDF code
  that breaks this version, but is free to use ignorable higher PDF
  features.


\subsection{Field option `name'}

 Many form objects uses the label argument
  for several purposes:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Layouted label.
 \item As name in HTML structures.
\end{itemize}
  Code that is suitable for layouting with TeX can
  break in the structures of the output format.
  If option `name' is given, then its value is used
  as name in the different output structures. Thus
  the value should consist of letters only.


\subsection{Option `pdfencoding'}

 The PDF format allows two encodings for bookmarks and entries
  in the information dictionary: PDFDocEncoding and Unicode
  as UTF-16BE. Option \xoption{pdfencoding} selects between these encodings:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \xoption{pdfdoc} uses PDFDocEncoding. It uses just one byte per character,
     but the supported characters are limited (244 in PDF-1.7).
 \item \xoption{unicode} sets Unicode. It is encoded as UTF-16BE. Two bytes
    are used for most characters, surrogates need four bytes.
 \item \xoption{auto} PDFDocEncoding if the string does not contain characters
    outside the encoding (outside ascii if an unicode engine is used)
    and Unicode otherwise. This option is not intended for the unicode engines.
\end{itemize}

 All drivers use \xoption{unicode} by default now. If another encoding should be forced,
 it should be done in \verb|hypersetup|.

\subsection{Color options/package hycolor}

 See documentation of package `hycolor'.


\subsection{Option pdfusetitle}

 If option pdfusetitle is set then hyperref tries to
  derive the values for pdftitle and pdfauthor from
  \verb|\title| and \verb|\author|. An optional argument for \verb|\title| and
  \verb|\author| is supported (class amsart).


\subsection{Starred form of \textbackslash autoref}

 \verb|\autoref*| generates a reference without link as \verb|\ref*| or \verb|\pageref*|.


\subsection{Link border style}

 Links can be underlined instead of the default rectangle or
  options \xoption{colorlinks}, \xoption{frenchlinks}. This is done by option
      \verb|pdfborderstyle={/S/U/W 1}|

  Some remarks:

\begin{itemize}
 \item AR7/Linux seems to have a bug, that don't use the default
    value \verb"1" for the width, but zero, thus that the underline
    is not visible without \verb"/W 1". The same applies for
    dashed boxes, eg.:
      pdfborderstyle={/S/D/D[3 2]/W 1}

 \item The syntax is described in the PDF specification, look for
    ``border style'', eg.
    Table 8.13 ``Entries in a border style dictionary''
    (specification for version 1.6)

 \item The border style is removed by
      pdfborderstyle={}
    This is automatically done if option colorlinks is enabled.

 \item Be aware that not all PDF viewers support this feature, not
    even Acrobat Reader itself:

    Some support:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item AR7/Linux: \xoption{underline} and \xoption{dashed}, but the border width
      must be given.
   \item xpdf 3.00: \xoption{underline} and \xoption{dashed}
   \end{itemize}

    Unsupported:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item AR5/Linux
   \item ghostscript 8.50
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option \xoption{bookmarksdepth}}

 The depth of the bookmarks can be controlled by the new
  option \xoption{bookmarksdepth}.  The option acts globally and
  distinguishes three cases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \xoption{bookmarksdepth} without value
     Then hyperref uses the current value of counter \xoption{tocdepth}.
     This is the compatible behaviour and the default.
 \item \verb"bookmarksdepth=<number>", the value is number (also negative):
    The depth for the bookmarks are set to this number.
 \item \verb"bookmarksdepth=<name>"
    The <name> is a document division name (part, chapter, ...).
    It must not start with a digit or minus to avoid mixing up
    with the number case. Internally hyperref uses the value
    of macro \verb|\toclevel@<name>|.
  Examples:
\begin{verbatim}
    \hypersetup{bookmarksdepth=paragraph}
    \hypersetup{bookmarksdepth=4} % same as before
    \hypersetup{bookmarksdepth} % counter "tocdepth" is used
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Option \xoption{pdfescapeform}}

 There are many places where arbitrary strings end up as
  PS or PDF strings. The PS/PDF strings in parentheses form
  require the protection of some characters, e.g. unmatched
  left or right parentheses need escaping or the escape
  character itself (backslash).
    Since 2006/02/12~v6.75a the PS/PDF driver should do
  this automatically. However I assume a problem with
  compatibility, especially regarding the form part where
  larger amounts of JavaScript code can be present.
  It would be a pain to remove all the escaping, because
  an additional escaping layer can falsify the code.

  Therefore a new option pdfescapeform was introduced:
\begin{itemize}
 \item pdfescapeform=false
    Escaping for the formulars are disabled, this is
    the compatibility behaviour, therefore this is the default.
 \item pdfescapeform=true
    Then the PS/PDF drivers do all the necessary escaping.
    This is the logical choice and the recommended setting.
    For example, the user writes JavaScript as JavaScript
    and do not care about escaping characters for PS/PDF
    output.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Default driver setting}

 (hyperref $\ge$ 6.72s)
  If no driver is given, hyperref tries its best to guess the
  most suitable driver. Thus it loads \xoption{hpdftex}, if pdfTeX is
  detected running in PDF mode. Or it loads the corresponding
  VTeX driver for VTeX's working modes.
    Unhappily many driver programs run after the TeX compiler,
  so hyperref does not have a chance (dvips, dvipdfm, ...).
  In this case driver \xoption{hypertex} is loaded that supports the
  HyperTeX features that are recognized by xdvi for example.
  This behaviour, however, can easily be changed in the configuration
  file \verb"hyperref.cfg":
\begin{verbatim}
    \providecommand*{\Hy@defaultdriver}{hdvips}
\end{verbatim}
  for dvips, or
\begin{verbatim}
    \providecommand*{\Hy@defaultdriver}{hypertex}
\end{verbatim}
  for the default behaviour of hyperref.

 See also the new option `driverfallback'.

\subsection{Backref entries}

 Alternative interface for formatting of backref entries, example:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt,UKenglish]{article}

\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage[pagebackref]{hyperref}

% Some language options are detected by package backref.
% This affects the following macros:
%   \backrefpagesname
%   \backrefsectionsname
%   \backrefsep
%   \backreftwosep
%   \backreflastsep

\renewcommand*{\backref}[1]{
  % default interface
  % #1: backref list
  %
  % We want to use the alternative interface,
  % therefore the definition is empty here.
}
\renewcommand*{\backrefalt}[4]{%
  % alternative interface
  % #1: number of distinct back references
  % #2: backref list with distinct entries
  % #3: number of back references including duplicates
  % #4: backref list including duplicates
  \par
  #3 citation(s) on #1 page(s): #2,\par
  \ifnum#1=1 %
    \ifnum#3=1 %
      1 citation on page %
    \else
      #3 citations on page %
    \fi
  \else
    #3 citations on #1 pages %
  \fi
  #2,\par
  \ifnum#3=1 %
    1 citation located at page %
  \else
    #3 citations located at pages %
  \fi
  #4.\par
}

% The list of distinct entries can be further refined:
\renewcommand*{\backrefentrycount}[2]{%
  % #1: the original backref entry
  % #2: the count of citations of this entry,
  %     in case of duplicates greater than one
  #1%
  \ifnum#2>1 %
    ~(#2)%
  \fi
}

\begin{document}

  \section{Hello}
    \cite{ref1, ref2, ref3, ref4}
  \section{World}
    \cite{ref1, ref3}
  \newpage

  \section{Next section}
    \cite{ref1}
  \newpage

  \section{Last section}
    \cite{ref1, ref2}
  \newpage

  \pdfbookmark[1]{Bibliography}{bib}
  \begin{thebibliography}{99}
    \bibitem{ref1} Dummy entry one.

    \bibitem{ref2} Dummy entry two.

    \bibitem{ref3} Dummy entry three.

    \bibitem{ref4} Dummy entry four.

  \end{thebibliography}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\textbackslash phantomsection}

Set an anchor at this location.  It is often used in conjunction
with \verb|\addcontentsline| for sectionlike things (index, bibliography,
preface). \verb|\addcontentsline| refers to the latest previous location
where an anchor is set.

\begin{verbatim}
  \cleardoublepage
  \phantomsection
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\indexname}
  \printindex
\end{verbatim}

Now the entry in the table of contents (and bookmarks) for the
index points to the start of the index page, not to a location
before this page.

\subsection{puenc encoding, puenc-greek.def and puenc-extra.def}

The \texttt{unicode} option loads for the bookmarks \texttt{puenc.def} which contains
quite a lot definitions of commands for the bookmarks.
As \texttt{unicode} is now true for all engines, this file is now also loaded
with pdflatex. Some of the definitions in \texttt{puenc.def} clash with other uses.
To reduce the impact \xpackage{hyperref} uses two strategies.

\begin{itemize}
\item A number of command are only defined conditionally:
The commands for the cyrillic block  if \cs{CYRDZE} is defined,
greek if \cs{textBeta} is defined, and hebrew if \cs{hebdalet} is defined.

The greek block is in an extra file, \texttt{puenc-greek.def}, which can
be loaded manually if needed.

\item Other commands are moved to an extra file \texttt{puenc-extra.def}
which is not loaded automatically, but can be loaded in the preamble if needed.
Currently this file contains all definitions for the accent \cs{G}.
\end{itemize}



\section{Acrobat-specific behavior}
If you want to access the menu options of Acrobat Reader or Exchange, the following
macro is provided in the appropriate drivers:

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{Acrobatmenu}\verb|{|\emph{menuoption}\verb|}{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\noindent The \emph{text} is used to create a button which activates the appropriate \emph{menuoption}. The following table lists the option names you can use---comparison of this with the menus in Acrobat Reader or Exchange will show what they do. Obviously some are only appropriate to Exchange.

\section{PDF and HTML forms}
You must put your fields inside a \texttt{Form} environment.
The environment does some general setups, so should be used only once in a document.
Using simply \cs{Form} at the begin of the document is possible too.

There are six macros to prepare fields:

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{TextField}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{CheckBox}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{ChoiceMenu}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}{|\emph{choices}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{PushButton}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{Submit}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{Reset}\verb|[|\emph{parameters}\verb|]{|\emph{label}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

The way forms and their labels are laid out is determined by:
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{LayoutTextField}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}{|\emph{field}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{LayoutChoiceField}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}{|\emph{field}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{LayoutCheckField}\verb|{|\emph{label}\verb|}{|\emph{field}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

These macros default to \#1 \#2

What is actually shown in the field is determined by:
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{MakeRadioField}\verb|{|\emph{width}\verb|}{|\emph{height}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{MakeCheckField}\verb|{|\emph{width}\verb|}{|\emph{height}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{MakeTextField}\verb|{|\emph{width}\verb|}{|\emph{height}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}
\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{MakeChoiceField}\verb|{|\emph{width}\verb|}{|\emph{height}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

\begin{cmdsyntax}
\ci{MakeButtonField}\verb|{|\emph{text}\verb|}|
\end{cmdsyntax}

These macros default to \verb|\vbox to #2{\hbox to #1{\hfill}\vfill}|, except the
last, which defaults to \#1; it is used for buttons, and the special \ci{Submit} and \ci{Reset}
macros.

You may also want to redefine the following macros:
\begin{verbatim}
\def\DefaultHeightofSubmit{12pt}
\def\DefaultWidthofSubmit{2cm}
\def\DefaultHeightofReset{12pt}
\def\DefaultWidthofReset{2cm}
\def\DefaultHeightofCheckBox{0.8\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultWidthofCheckBox{0.8\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultHeightofChoiceMenu{0.8\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultWidthofChoiceMenu{0.8\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultHeightofText{\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultHeightofTextMultiline{4\baselineskip}
\def\DefaultWidthofText{3cm}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Forms environment parameters}

\smallskip
\begin{longtable}{@{}>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}lp{9cm}@{}}

\section{Defining a new driver}
A hyperref driver has to provide definitions for eight macros:

\smallskip
\noindent 1. \verb|\hyper@anchor|

\noindent 2. \verb|\hyper@link|

\noindent 3. \verb|\hyper@linkfile|

\noindent 4. \verb|\hyper@linkurl|

\noindent 5. \verb|\hyper@anchorstart|

\noindent 6. \verb|\hyper@anchorend|

\noindent 7. \verb|\hyper@linkstart|

\noindent 8. \verb|\hyper@linkend|
\smallskip

The draft option defines the macros as follows
\begin{verbatim}
\let\hyper@@anchor\@gobble
\gdef\hyper@link##1##2##3{##3}%
\def\hyper@linkurl##1##2{##1}%
\def\hyper@linkfile##1##2##3{##1}%
\let\hyper@anchorstart\@gobble
\let\hyper@anchorend\@empty
\let\hyper@linkstart\@gobbletwo
\let\hyper@linkend\@empty
\end{verbatim}

\section{Special support for other packages}

Package \xpackage{hyperref} aims to cooperate with other packages, but there are
several possible sources for conflict, such as

\begin{itemize}

\item Packages that manipulate the bibliographic mechanism. Peter
William's \xpackage{harvard} package is supported. However, the
recommended package is Patrick Daly's \xpackage{natbib} package that has
specific \xpackage{hyperref} hooks to allow reliable interaction. This
package covers a very wide variety of layouts and citation styles, all
of which work with \xpackage{hyperref}.

\item Packages that typeset the contents of the \ci{label} and \ci{ref}
macros, such as \xpackage{showkeys}. Since the \xpackage{hyperref} package
redefines these commands, you must set \texttt{implicit=false} for these
packages to work.

\item Packages that do anything serious with the index.
\end{itemize}

The \xpackage{hyperref} package is distributed with variants on two useful
packages designed to work especially well with it. These are \xpackage{xr}
and \xpackage{minitoc}, which support crossdocument links using \hologo{LaTeX}'s
normal \cs{label}/\cs{ref} mechanisms and per-chapter tables of contents,
respectively.


\subsection{Package Compatibility}

Currently only package loading orders are available:



Note: hyperref loads package \xpackage{nameref} at \verb|\begin{document}|.
Sometimes this is too late, thus this package must be loaded
earlier.


\subsubsection{algorithm}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{float}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage[chapter]{algorithm}% eg.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{amsmath}

 The environments equation and eqnarray are not supported too well.
  For example, there might be spacing problems (eqnarray isn't recommended
  anyway, see CTAN:info/l2tabu/, the situation for equation is unclear,
  because nobody is interested in investigating). Consider using the
  environments that package amsmath provide, e.g. gather for equation.
  The environment equation can even redefined to use gather:

\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \let\equation\gather
  \let\endequation\endgather
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{amsrefs}

 Package loading order:

\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{amsrefs}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{arydshln, longtable}

 Package longtable must be put before hyperref and arydshln,
  hyperref after arydshln generates an error, thus the
  resulting package order is then:

\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{longtable}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{arydshln}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{babel/magyar.ldf}

 The old version 2005/03/30 v1.4j will not work.
  You need at least version 1.5, maintained by P\'eter Szab\'o,
  see CTAN:language/hungarian/babel/.


\subsubsection{babel/spanish.ldf}

 Babel's spanish.ldf redefines `\verb|\.|' to support `\verb|\...|'.
  In bookmarks (\verb|\pdfstringdef|) only `\verb|\.|' is supported.
  If `\verb|\...|' is needed,
    \verb|\texorpdfstring{\...}{\dots}|
  can be used instead.


\subsubsection{bibentry}

 Workaround:

\begin{verbatim}
  \makeatletter
  \let\saved@bibitem\@bibitem
  \makeatother

  \usepackage{bibentry}
  \usepackage{hyperref}

  \begin{document}

  \begingroup
    \makeatletter
    \let\@bibitem\saved@bibitem
    \nobibliography{database}
  \endgroup
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{bigfoot}

 Hyperref does not support package `bigfoot'. And package
  `bigfoot' does not support hyperref's footnotes and disables
  them (hyperfootnotes=false).


\subsubsection{chappg}

 Package `chappg' uses \verb|\@addtoreset| that is redefined by `hyperref'.
  The package order is therefore:

\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{chappg}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{cite}

 This is from Mike Shell:
 cite.sty cannot currently be used with hyperref.
 However, I can do a workaround via:

\begin{verbatim}
 \makeatletter
 \def\NAT@parse{\typeout{This is a fake Natbib command to fool Hyperref.}}
 \makeatother

 \usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

 so that hyperref will not redefine any of the biblabel stuff - so cite.sty
 will work as normal - although the citations will not be hyperlinked, of
 course (But this may not be an issue for many people).


\subsubsection{count1to}

 Package `count1to' adds several \verb|\@addtoreset| commands that confuse
  `hyperref'. Therefore \verb|\theH<...>| has to be fixed:

\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{count1to}
  \AtBeginDocument{% *after* \usepackage{count1to}
    \renewcommand*{\theHsection}{\theHchapter.\arabic{section}}%
    \renewcommand*{\theHsubsection}{\theHsection.\arabic{subsection}}%
    \renewcommand*{\theHsubsubsection}{\theHsubsection.\arabic{subsubsection}}%
    \renewcommand*{\theHparagraph}{\theHsubsubsection.\arabic{paragraph}}%
    \renewcommand*{\theHsubparagraph}{\theHparagraph.\arabic{subparagraph}}%
  }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{dblaccnt}

 pd1enc.def or puenc.def should be loaded before:
\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{dblaccnt}
\end{verbatim}
  or see entry for \xoption{vietnam}.


\subsubsection{easyeqn}
 Not compatible, breaks.


\subsubsection{ellipsis}

 This packages redefines \verb|\textellipsis|
  after package hyperref (pd1enc.def/puenc.def should be loaded before):
\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{ellipsis}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{float}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{float}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Several \verb|\caption| commands are not supported inside one float object.
  \item Anchor are set at top of the float object, if its style is controlled
    by float.sty.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{endnotes}
 Unsupported.

\subsubsection{foiltex}
 Update to version 2008/01/28 v2.1.4b:
  Since version 6.77a hyperref does not hack into \verb|\@begindvi|,
  it uses package `atbegshi' instead, that hooks into \verb|\shipout|.
  Thus the patch of `foils.cls' regarding hyperref is now obsolete
  and causes an undefined error message about \verb|\@hyperfixhead|.
  This is fixed in FoilTeX 2.1.4b.


\subsubsection{footnote}

 This package is not supported, you have to disable hyperref's footnote
  support by using option \verb"hyperfootnotes=false".


\subsubsection{geometry}

 Driver `dvipdfm' and program `dvipdfm' might generate a warning:
      Sorry.  Too late to change page size
  Then prefer the program `dvipdfmx' or use one of the following
  workarounds to move the \verb|\special| of geometry to an earlier
  location:

\begin{verbatim}
    \documentclass[dvipdfm]{article}% or other classes
    \usepackage{atbegshi}
    \AtBeginDocument{%
      \let\OrgAtBeginDvi\AtBeginDvi
      \let\AtBeginDvi\AtBeginShipoutFirst
    }
    \usepackage[
      paperwidth=170mm,
      paperheight=240mm
    ]{geometry}
    \AtBeginDocument{%
      \let\AtBeginDvi\OrgAtBeginDvi
    }
    \usepackage{hyperref}

  or

    \documentclass[dvipdfm]{article}% or other classes
    \usepackage{atbegshi}
    \let\AtBeginDvi\AtBeginShipoutFirst
    \usepackage[
      paperwidth=170mm,
      paperheight=240mm
    ]{geometry}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{IEEEtran.cls}

 version $\ge$ V1.6b (because of \verb|\@makecaption|, see ChangeLog)


\subsubsection{index}

 version $\ge$ 1995/09/28 v4.1 (because of \verb|\addcontentsline| redefinition)


\subsubsection{lastpage}

 Compatible.


\subsubsection{linguex}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{linguex}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{ltabptch}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{longtable}
  \usepackage{ltabptch}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{mathenv}

 Unsupported.



 Both `mathenv' and `hyperref' messes around with
  environment `eqnarray'. You can load `mathenv' after
  `hyperref' to avoid an error message. But \verb|\label|
  will not work inside environment `eqnarray' properly,
  for example.


\subsubsection{minitoc-hyper}

 This package is obsolete, use the up-to-date original
  package minitoc instead.



\subsubsection{multind}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{multind}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{natbib}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{natbib}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{nomencl}
Example for introducing links for the page numbers:
\begin{verbatim}
      \renewcommand*{\pagedeclaration}[1]{\unskip, \hyperpage{#1}}
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{ntheorem-hyper}
 This package is obsolete, use the up-to-date original
  package ntheorem instead.


For equations the following might work:
\begin{verbatim}
      \renewcommand*{\eqdeclaration}[1]{%
        \hyperlink{equation.#1}{(Equation~#1)}%
      }
    But the mapping from the equation number to the anchor name
    is not available in general.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{parskip}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{parskip}
  \usepackage{hyperref}[2012/08/20]
\end{verbatim}


 Both packages want to redefine \verb|\@starttoc|.


\subsubsection{prettyref}
\begin{verbatim}
%%% example for prettyref %%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{prettyref}
\usepackage[pdftex]{hyperref}

%\newrefformat{FIG}{Figure~\ref{#1}}% without hyperref
\newrefformat{FIG}{\hyperref[{#1}]{Figure~\ref*{#1}}}

\begin{document}
  This is a reference to \prettyref{FIG:ONE}.
  \newpage
  \begin{figure}
    \caption{This is my figure}
    \label{FIG:ONE}
  \end{figure}
\end{document}
%%% example for prettyref %%%
      \end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{setspace}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{setspace}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{sidecap}
\begin{verbatim}
 Before 2002/05/24 v1.5h:
    \usepackage{nameref}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \usepackage{sidecap}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{subfigure}
\begin{verbatim}
 1995/03/06 v2.0:
    \usepackage{subfigure}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    % hypertexnames is set to false.
  v2.1:
    \usepackage{nameref}
    \usepackage{subfigure}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    or
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \usepackage{subfigure}
  v2.1.2:
    please update
  v2.1.3:
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \usepackage{subfigure}
    or vice versa?
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{titleref}
\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{nameref}
  \usepackage{titleref}% without usetoc
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{tabularx}

 Linked footnotes are not supported inside environment `tabularx',
  because they uses the optional argument of \verb|\footnotetext|, see
  section `Limitations'. Before version 2011/09/28 6.82i
  hyperref had disabled footnotes entirely by `hyperfootnotes=false'.


\subsubsection{titlesec}

 \xpackage{nameref} supports titlesec, but hyperref does not
  (unsolved is the anchor setting, missing with unnumbered
  section, perhaps problems with page breaks with numbered ones).


\subsubsection{ucs/utf8x.def}

 The first time a multibyte UTF8 sequence is called, it
  does some calculations and stores the result in a macro
  for speeding up the next calls of that UTF8 sequence.
  However this makes the first call non-expandable and
  will break if used in information entries or bookmarks.
  Package \xpackage{ucs} offers \verb|\PrerenderUnicode| or \verb|\PreloadUnicodePage|
  to solve this:
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage{ucs}
    \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
    \usepackage{hyperref}% or with option unicode
    \PrerenderUnicode{^^c3^^b6}% or \PrerenderUnicodePage{1}
    \hypersetup{pdftitle={Umlaut example: ^^c3^^b6}}
\end{verbatim}
  The notation with two carets avoids trouble with 8-bit bytes
  for the README file, you can use the characters directly.


\subsubsection{varioref}
 There are too many problems with varioref. Nobody has time to
  sort them out. Therefore this package is now unsupported.


 Perhaps you are lucky and some of the features of varioref works
  with the following loading order:
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage{nameref}
    \usepackage{varioref}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}


 Also some babel versions can be problematic. For example,
  2005/05/21 v3.8g contains a patch for varioref that breaks
  the hyperref support for varioref.



 Also unsupported:
\begin{itemize}
\item   \verb|\Ref|, \verb|\Vref| do not uppercase the first letter.
\item \verb|\vpageref[]{...}|
    On the same page a previous space is not suppressed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{verse}

 Version 2005/08/22 v2.22 contains support for hyperref.

  For older versions see example from
  de.comp.text.tex (2005/08/11, slightly modified):

\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass{article}

  % package order does not matter
  \usepackage{verse}
  \usepackage{hyperref}

  \makeatletter
  % make unique poemline anchors
  \newcounter{verse@env}
  \setcounter{verse@env}{0}
  \let\org@verse\verse
  \def\verse{%
    \stepcounter{verse@env}%
    \org@verse
  }
  \def\theHpoemline{\arabic{verse@env}.\thepoemline}

  % add anchor for before \addcontentsline in \@vsptitle
  \let\org@vsptitle\@vsptitle
  \def\@vsptitle{%
    \phantomsection
    \org@vsptitle
  }
  \makeatother

  \begin{document}

  \poemtitle{Poem 1}
  \begin{verse}
  An one-liner.
  \end{verse}

  \newpage

  \poemtitle{Poem 2}
  \begin{verse}
  Another one-liner.
  \end{verse}

  \end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{vietnam}
\begin{verbatim}
 % pd1enc.def should be loaded before package dblaccnt:
  \usepackage[PD1,OT1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{vietnam}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{XeTeX}

 Default for the encoding of bookmarks is \verb|pdfencoding=unicode|.
 That means the strings are always treated as unicode strings.
 If \verb|auto| or \verb|pdfdoc| is forced it applies only
 if the string restricts to the printable ASCII set,
 The reason is that the \verb|\special| does not support PDFDocEncoding.

 In older versions hyperref contained special conversion code from
 UTF-16BE back to UTF-8 in a number of places for
 xetex to avoid the xdvipdfmx warning

   \verb"Failed to convert input string to UTF16..."

 This is no longer needed with a current xdvipdfmx, so this code has
 been removed. \verb|\csname HyPsd@XeTeXBigCharstrue\endcsname| should no
 longer be used.


\section[Limitations]{Limitations%
\footnote{This section moved from the README file, needs more integration into the manual}}
\subsection{Wrapped/broken link support}

 Only few drivers support automatically wrapped/broken links,
  e.g. pdftex, dvipdfm, hypertex. Other drivers lack this
  feature, e.g. dvips, dvipsone.

  Workarounds:
\begin{itemize}
\item For long section or caption titles in the table of contents
    or list of figures/tables option \xoption{linktocpage} can be used.
    Then the page number will be a link, and the overlong section
    title is not forced into an one line link with overfull \verb|\hbox|
    warning.
\item ``\verb|\url|''s are caught by package \xpackage{breakurl}.
\item  The option \xoption{breaklinks} is intended for internal use. But it
    can be used to force link wrapping, e.g. when printing a
    document. However, when such a document is converted to PDF
    and viewed with a PDF viewer, the active link area will be
    misplaced.

      Another limitation: some penalties are ``optimized'' by TeX,
    thus there are missing break points, especially within
    \verb|\url|. (See thread ``hyperref.sty, breaklinks and url.sty 3.2''
    in comp.text.tex 2005-09).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Links across pages}

 In general they have problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Some driver doesn't support them at all (see above).
  \item The driver allows it, but the link result might include
    the footer and/or header, or an error message can
    occur sometimes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Footnotes}

 LaTeX allows the separation of the footnote mark and the
  footnote text (\verb|\footnotemark|, \verb|\footnotetext|). This interface
  might be enough for visual typesetting. But the relation between
  \verb|\footnotemark| to \verb|\footnotetext| is not as strong as \verb|\ref| to \verb|\label|.
  Therefore it is not clear in general which \verb|\footnotemark| references
  which \verb|\footnotetext|. But that is necessary to implement hyperlinking.
  Thus the implementation of hyperref does not support the optional
  argument of \verb|\footnotemark| and \verb|\footnotetext|.


\section[Hints]{Hints%
\footnote{This section moved from the README file, needs more integration into the manual}}

\subsection{Spaces in option values}

 Unhappily LaTeX strips spaces from options if they are given
  in \verb|\documentclass| or \verb|\usepackage| (or \verb|\RequirePackage|), e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[pdfborder=0 0 1]{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}
  Package hyperref now gets
\begin{verbatim}
    pdfborder=001
\end{verbatim}
  and the result is an invalid PDF file.
  As workaround braces can be used:
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[pdfborder={0 0 1}]{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}
  Some options can also be given in \verb|\hypersetup|
\begin{verbatim}
    \hypersetup{pdfborder=0 0 1}
\end{verbatim}
  In \verb|\hypersetup| the options are directly processed as key value
  options (see package keyval) without space stripping in the value part.



 Alternatively, LaTeX's option handling system can be adapted
  to key value options by one of the packages \xpackage{kvoptions-patch}
  (from project \xpackage{kvoptions}) or \xpackage{xkvltxp} (from project \xpackage{xsetkeys}).


\subsection{Index with makeindex}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Package hyperref adds \verb|\hyperpage| commands by the encap
    mechanism (see documentation of Makeindex),
    if option hyperindex is set (default).
    \verb|\hyperpage| uses the page anchors that are set by
    hyperref at each page (default). However in the
    default case page numbers are used in anchor names
    in arabic form. If the page numbers in other formats
    are used (book class with \verb|\frontmatter|, \verb|\romannumbering|, ...),
    then the page anchors are not unique. Therefore option
    \verb"plainpages=false" is recommended.
 \item The encap mechanism of Makeindex allows to use one command only
    (see documentation of Makeindex).
    If the user sets such a command, hyperref suppresses its
    \verb|\hyperpage| command. With logical markup this situation
    can easily be solved:
\begin{verbatim}
      \usepackage{makeidx}
      \makeindex
      \usepackage[hyperindex]{hyperref}
      \newcommand*{\main}[1]{\textbf{\hyperpage{#1}}}
      ...
      \index{Some example|main}
\end{verbatim}
  \item Scientic Word/Scientific WorkPlace users can use
    package robustindex with hyperindex=false.
  \item Other encap characters can be set by option \xoption{encap}.
    Example for use of ``?'':
\begin{verbatim}
      \usepackage[encap=?]{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}
  \item Another possibility is the insertion of \verb|\hyperpage| by
    a style file for makeindex. For this case, hyperref's
    insertion will be disabled by \verb"hyperindex=false".
    \verb|\hyperpage| will be defined regardless of setting of hyperindex.
\begin{verbatim}
%%% cut %%% hyperindex.ist %%% cut %%%
delim_0 ", \\hyperpage{"
delim_1 ", \\hyperpage{"
delim_2 ", \\hyperpage{"
delim_n "}, \\hyperpage{"
delim_t "}"
encap_prefix "}\\"
encap_infix "{\\hyperpage{"
encap_suffix "}"
%%% cut %%% hyperindex.ist %%% cut %%%
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Warning \texttt{"bookmark level for unknown <foobar> defaults to 0"}}

 Getting rid of it:
\begin{verbatim}
\makeatletter
\providecommand*{\toclevel@<foobar>}{0}
\makeatother
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Link anchors in figures}

 The caption command increments the counter and here is the
  place where hyperref set the corresponding anchor. Unhappily
  the caption is set below the figure, so the figure is not
  visible if a link jumps to a figure.
    In this case, try package \xpackage{hypcap} that implements
  a method to circumvent the problem.


\subsection{Additional unicode characters in bookmarks and pdf information entries:}
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[pdftex]{article}
\usepackage[unicode]{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}

Support for additional unicode characters:

 Example: \verb|\.{a}| and \verb|\d{a}|

 1. Get a list with unicode data, eg:

    http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt

 2. Identify the characters (\verb|\.{a}|, \verb|\d{a}|):
\begin{verbatim}
    0227;LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DOT ABOVE;...
    1EA1;LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DOT BELOW;...
\end{verbatim}

 3. Calculate the octal code:

    The first characters of the line in the file are
    hex values, convert each byte and prepend them
    with a backslash. (This will go into the PDF file.)

\begin{verbatim}
    0227 -> \002\047
    1EA1 -> \036\241
\end{verbatim}

 4. Transform into a form understood by hyperref:

    Hyperref must know where the first byte starts,
    this is marked by \verb"9" (8 and 9 cannot occur in
    octal numbers):

\begin{verbatim}
    \002\047 -> \9002\047
    \036\241 -> \9036\241
\end{verbatim}

    Optional: \verb"8" is used for abbreviations:

\begin{verbatim}
    \900 = \80, \901 = \81, \902 = \82, ...

    \9002\047 -> \82\047
\end{verbatim}

 5. Declare the character with LaTeX:

\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\.}{PU}{a}{\82\047}
\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\d}{PU}{a}{\9036\241}

\begin{document}
\section{\={a}, \d{a}, \'{a}, \.{a}}
\end{document}
      \end{verbatim}

\subsection{Footnotes}

 The footnote support is rather limited. It is beyond the scope
  to use \verb|\footnotemark| and \verb|\footnotetext| out of order or reusing
  \verb|\footnotemark|. Here you can either disable hyperref's footnote
  support by \verb"hyperfootnotes=false" or fiddle with internal macros,
  nasty examples:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
Hello%
\footnote{The first footnote}
World%
\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%
\addtocounter{Hfootnote}{-1}%
\footnotemark.
\end{document}

  or

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}

\makeatletter

A%
  \footnotemark
  \let\saved@Href@A\Hy@footnote@currentHref
  % remember link name
B%
  \footnotemark
  \let\saved@Href@B\Hy@footnote@currentHref
b%
  \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%
  \addtocounter{Hfootnote}{-1}% generate the same anchor
  \footnotemark
C%
  \footnotemark
  \let\saved@Href@C\Hy@footnote@currentHref

  \addtocounter{footnote}{-2}%
  \let\Hy@footnote@currentHref\saved@Href@A
\footnotetext{AAAA}%
  \addtocounter{footnote}{1}%
  \let\Hy@footnote@currentHref\saved@Href@B
\footnotetext{BBBBB}%
  \addtocounter{footnote}{1}%
  \let\Hy@footnote@currentHref\saved@Href@C
\footnotetext{CCCC}%

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Subordinate counters}

 Some counters do not have unique values and require the value
  of other counters to be unique. For example, sections or figures
  might be numbered within chapters or \verb|\newtheorem| is used with
  an optional counter argument. Internally LaTeX uses \verb|\@addtoreset|
  to reset a counter in dependency to another counter. Package
  hyperref hooks into \verb|\@addtoreset| to catch this situation.
  Also \verb|\numberwithin| of package amsmath is caught by hyperref.



 However, if the definition of subordinate counters take place
  before hyperref is loaded, the old meaning of \verb|\@addtoreset| is
  called without hyperref's additions. Then the companion counter
  macro \verb|\theH<counter>| can be redefined accordingly. Or move the
  definition of subordinate counters after hyperref is loaded.

 Example for \verb|\newtheorem|, problematic case:
\begin{verbatim}
    \newtheorem{corA}{CorollaryA}[section]
    \usepackage{hyperref}
\end{verbatim}
  Solution a)
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \newtheorem{corA}{CorollaryA}[section}
\end{verbatim}
  Solution b)
\begin{verbatim}
    \newtheorem{corA}{CorollaryA}[section]
    \usepackage{hyperref}
    \newcommand*{\theHcorA}{\theHsection.\number\value{corA}}
\end{verbatim}

\section{History and acknowledgments}

The original authors of \textsf{hyperbasics.tex} and
\textsf{hypertex.sty}, from which this package descends, are Tanmoy
Bhattacharya and Thorsten Ohl. Package \xpackage{hyperref}
started as a simple port of their work to \hologo{LaTeXe} standards, but
eventually I rewrote nearly everything, because I didn't understand a
lot of the original, and was only interested in getting it to work with
\hologo{LaTeX}. I would like to thank Arthur Smith, Tanmoy Bhattacharya, Mark
Doyle, Paul Ginsparg, David Carlisle, T.\ V.\ Raman and Leslie Lamport
for comments, requests, thoughts and code to get the package into its
first useable state. Various other people are mentioned at the point in
the source where I had to change the code in later versions because of
problems they found.

Tanmoy found a great many of the bugs, and (even better) often provided
fixes, which has made the package more robust. The days spent on
Rev\TeX\ are entirely due to him! The investigations of Bill Moss
into the later versions including
native PDF support uncovered a good many bugs, and his testing is
appreciated. Hans Hagen provided a lot of
insight into PDF.

Berthold Horn provided help, encouragement and sponsorship for the
\textsf{dvipsone} and \textsf{dviwindo} drivers. Sergey Lesenko provided
the changes needed for \textsf{dvipdf}, and \Hologo{HanTheThanh} supplied all the
information needed for \textsf{pdftex}. Patrick Daly kindly updated his
\xpackage{natbib} package to allow easy integration with
\xpackage{hyperref}. Michael Mehlich's \xpackage{hyper} package (developed
in parallel with \textsf{hyperref}) showed me solutions for some
problems. Hopefully the two packages will combine one day.

The forms creation section owes a great deal to: T.\ V.\ Raman, for
encouragement, support and ideas; Thomas Merz, whose book \emph{Web
Publishing with Acrobat/PDF} provided crucial insights; D.\ P.\ Story,
whose detailed article about pdfmarks and forms solved many practical
problems; and Hans Hagen, who explained how to do it in \textsf{pdftex}.

Steve Peter recreated the manual source in July 2003 after it had been
lost.

Especial extra thanks to David Carlisle for the \xpackage{backref} module,
the ps2pdf and dviwindo support, frequent general rewrites of my bad
code, and for working on changes to the \xpackage{xr} package to suit

\chapter{GNU Free Documentation License}

Version 1.2, November 2002


 Copyright \copyright\ 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\\
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


\section*{PREAMBLE}

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


\section{APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS}
\label{applicability}

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``Document'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``you''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, \LaTeX\ input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section ``Entitled XYZ'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', ``Endorsements'', or ``History''.)  To ``Preserve the Title''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


\section{VERBATIM COPYING}
\label{verbatim}

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
section~\ref{copying}.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


\section{COPYING IN QUANTITY}
\label{copying}

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


\section{MODIFICATIONS}
\label{modifications}

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections~\ref{verbatim} and \ref{copying} above,
provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
\item List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
\item State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
\item Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\item Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
\item Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\item Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\item Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\item Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
\item Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
\item For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
\item Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
\item Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
\item Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
\item Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

\end{enumerate}

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


\section{COMBINING DOCUMENTS}
\label{combining}

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section~\ref{modifications}
above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
Entitled ``Endorsements''.


\section{COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}
\label{collections}

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


\section{AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}
\label{aggregation}

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section~\ref{copying} is applicable to
these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


\section{TRANSLATION}
\label{translation}

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
section~\ref{modifications}.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement
(section~\ref{modifications}) to Preserve
its Title (section~\ref{applicability}) will typically require
changing the actual title.


\section{TERMINATION}
\label{termination}

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


\section{FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}
\label{future}

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


\section*{ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents}

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

\begin{quote}
    Copyright \copyright\ YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.
\end{quote}

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with...Texts.'' line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
